    Challenge


Varun has got a date after a long time and wants to look his best for his partner. He decides to go shopping to buy a new t-shirt and a pair of jeans but since it is the monthâ€™s end, he has a budget of only B rupees. He wants to spend the maximum money on jeans and t-shirt combo within the given budget. The problem is that he is good with his cloth choices but not with the calculations and asks for your help. 

Varun has selected T t-shirts and J jeans. He provides you the prices of each of them and you have to determine the maximum money he can spend shopping. If it is not possible to buy the jeans and t-shirt with the given budget, you can tell him -1.

Example:
1. 
Budget, B = 20
Jeans, Ji = [ 10, 5, 8 ]
T-shirts, Ti = [ 11, 7, 4 ]

The maximum money he can spend is 19 by buying the J3 jeans along with the T1 t-shirt.

2.
Budget, B = 10
Jeans, Ji = [ 8 , 9 , 10 ]
T-shirt, Ti = [ 4, 6, 3 ]

With the given budget, it is not possible for Varun to buy the jeans and t-shirt both. Thus, the maximum money he can spend is -1.

Can you help him shop and get ready for his date?
